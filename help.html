            <li>Struggling with everyday tasks or losing interest in activities you once enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Experiencing changes in sleep patterns, appetite, or energy levels.</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions.</li>
            <li>Withdrawing from social interactions or isolating yourself from loved ones.</li>
            <li>Having thoughts of harming yourself or others.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Talk to Someone You Trust:</strong> Start by talking to a family member, friend, or colleague who can offer support. Sometimes, simply sharing your feelings with someone can help alleviate the burden.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact a Mental Health Professional:</strong> Reach out to a licensed therapist, counselor, or psychologist. They can help you explore your feelings, identify underlying issues, and develop coping strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Visit Your Primary Care Provider:</strong> Your doctor can help assess your mental health and refer you to a mental health specialist if needed.</li>
