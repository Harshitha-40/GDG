        <h2>Introduction to Exercise & Fitness</h2>
        <p>Exercising regularly — every day if possible — is the single most important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers.</p>

        <h2>Why is exercise so important for seniors?</h2>

            <!-- Paragraph Section -->
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Exercise is vital for seniors, offering numerous benefits like improved heart health, stronger muscles, better sleep, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases. Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy blood pressure, reduces inflammation, strengthens bones, and combats depression. It can also improve sex life, reduce the risk of cancer, and increase life expectancy.</p>

                <p>Starting small with daily movements like walking or yard work is a great way to begin. The goal should be 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, but any movement is better than none. Always consult a doctor before starting, especially if you have health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis.</p>

        <h2>What are the best types of exercise?</h2>
        <p>The following are 3 of the best types of exercises you can include in your routine:</p>

        <!-- Cardiovascular Exercise Section -->
        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="text-content">
                <h3>💓 Cardiovascular (Cardio)</h3>
                <p>Cardio exercises are activities that get your heart rate up and improve the health of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. Common cardio exercises include running, cycling, swimming, and brisk walking. These activities help improve cardiovascular health, increase stamina, and burn calories, making them ideal for weight loss and overall fitness. Regular cardio reduces the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and stroke, while also improving mental health by releasing endorphins that boost mood and reduce stress.</p>
                <p>Cardio workouts improve heart health and stamina. Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🏃 Running / Jogging</li>
                    <li>🚴 Cycling</li>
                    <li>🏊 Swimming</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="text-content">
                <h3>🏋 Strength Training</h3>
                <p>Strength training involves exercises that build muscle and increase strength through resistance. Common examples include weightlifting, bodyweight exercises like push-ups and squats, and resistance band workouts. This type of exercise strengthens muscles, boosts metabolism, improves bone density, and enhances overall body stability. Regular strength training not only helps with muscle growth but also supports joint health, prevents injuries, and aids in fat loss by increasing the body's resting metabolic rate. It's an essential component of any fitness routine, helping you build and maintain a strong, toned body.</p>
                <p>Helps in muscle growth and boosts metabolism. Examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>💪 Weight Lifting</li>
                    <li>🦵 Squats & Lunges</li>
                    <li>🚀 Resistance Bands</li>

                <h3>🧘 Yoga & Flexibility</h3>
                <p>Yoga is a practice that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to improve flexibility, balance, and mental well-being. Regular yoga sessions help stretch and lengthen muscles, reduce stiffness, and increase range of motion. It not only improves physical flexibility but also enhances mental clarity, reduces stress, and promotes relaxation. Whether through dynamic flows like Vinyasa or calming poses in Hatha Yoga, incorporating yoga into your routine helps improve posture, alleviate tension, and foster a sense of peace and mindfulness.</p>
                <p>Improves balance, flexibility, and relaxation.</p>
